# Device Checker	

## Overview

There are lots of great sites to send clients to when you need to fix a bug, like supportdetails.com, but this isn't quite the same thing. This grabs a few details from the browser I wanted easy access to for front-end development.

I wanted something that would load lightening-fast and scale to any device. I also wanted a short url to attach to it so when I visit my local device lab (ie: electronics/phone store) I can load it up without drawing attention. Currently I have set up a bit.ly url, but plan to add my own url shortener in the future.

I'm not fluent in JS, so this is dirt simple (with the exception of the code used for Browser version info from http://www.javascripter.net/faq/browsern.htm). Feel free to use and abuse this however you see fit!

## Details

- This is a one page file (HTML, CSS, & JS) to eliminate dependencies and requests.
- The CSS is simple—just a few lines to make the markup more presentable.
- The JS is simple, too—no jQuery or anything complicated.
